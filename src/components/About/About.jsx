              In 2010, a female tailor from Sudamerica opened the first cloth
              factory in the region. The factory quickly became a success,
              providing high quality fabrics to the local market. The factory's
              success allowed the tailor to open additional factories in the
              years that followed, eventually becoming the leading provider of
              cloth in Sudamerica.
